{% include default_toc.html %}

After you've [set up](setup.html) your App Engine development environment,
you can create a simple Dart app and run it locally using the App Engine
development server.

## Create a Dart project

All App Engine applications require an `app.yaml` file,
which configures certain aspects of the application.
This file lives in the top directory of a Dart App Engine project.

Create a `helloworld` directory; this is the
directory for the Dart project you are creating&mdash;a
simple "HelloWorld" example. Change directories into `helloworld`.

{% prettify sh %}
$ mkdir helloworld
$ cd helloworld
{% endprettify %}

Create `app.yaml` with the following content:

{% prettify yaml %}
version: helloworld
[[highlight]]runtime: custom[[/highlight]]
[[highlight]]vm: true[[/highlight]]
api_version: 1
{% endprettify %}

The `version` field in the `app.yaml` file is the way that App Engine
distinguishes between different deployed application instances.

Create `Dockerfile` with the following content:

{% prettify yaml %}
FROM google/dart-runtime
{% endprettify %}

## Create a pubspec.yaml file

Your application needs several Dart packages
for use with App Engine.
The `pubspec.yaml` file specifies package dependencies for a Dart program.
Create <code>pubspec.yaml</code> file with the following content:

{% prettify yaml %}
name: helloworld
version: 0.1.0
author: <your name>
dependencies:
  appengine: '>=0.2.1 <0.3.0'
{% endprettify %}

## Create the Dart source file

In this step, you create the `bin/server.dart` file
that contains the `main()` method for the Dart program.
The Dart runtime for App Engine always starts by running 
the `bin/server.dart` file.
This file launches a Dart runtime instance on App Engine,
and passes a method for handling HTTP requests to App Engine.

Create the `bin` directory in the `helloworld` directory.

{% prettify sh %}
$ mkdir bin
{% endprettify  %}

Now, create `bin/server.dart` with the code
for the HelloWorld example:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:io';

import 'package:appengine/appengine.dart';

main() {
  runAppEngine((HttpRequest request) {
    request.response..write('Hello, world!')
                    ..close();
  });
}
{% endprettify %}

Your directory structure should look like this:

### The HelloWorld code explained

*   The `appengine` library imported by `server.dart`
    includes the top-level method `runAppEngine()`,
    which starts Dart's runtime and connects it to App Engine.

*   `runAppEngine()` takes a callback function as a parameter.
    This function handles HTTP requests.
    In the HelloWorld example, the HTTP request handler
    function is `requestHandler`.

*   The request handler receives an
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/HttpRequest.html" target="_blank">HttpRequest</a>
    object as a parameter.
    This object contains information about the request.
    The server also sends its response through the
    HttpRequest object's `response` member.
    For more information about Dart servers refer to
    [Write HTTP Clients & Servers](/docs/tutorials/httpserver/).

## Run pub get

You now need to install the required libraries into the HelloWorld project.
You do this with the `pub get` command, which you got, along with some
other command line tools, when you downloaded Dart.

From the `helloworld` directory, run `pub get`.

{% prettify sh %}
$ pub get
$ cd ..
{% endprettify %}

You can run the `pub get` command to resolve any dependencies for your app.
During deployment `pub get` runs automatically at the server side to
ensure that the needed packages are available.

## Pull the Docker images

Pull the Docker images using the following command:

{% prettify sh %}
$ docker pull google/dart-runtime
{% endprettify %}

This step can take awhile but needs to be done only once.

## Run the app using App Engine

Run the application using the following `gcloud preview app`
command. This command allows you to run the app locally using the
App Engine development server.

{% prettify sh %}
$ gcloud preview app run app.yaml
{% endprettify %}

The `gcloud` output includes lines similar to the following:

{% prettify none %}

[/usr/local/prj/dart/appengine/apps/hello/app.yaml]

{% endprettify %}

**Note:**
If the `preview app run` command fails with the following error:

<pre>
The --custom_entrypoint flag must be set for custom runtimes
ERROR: (gcloud.preview.app.run) DevAppSever failed with error code [1]
</pre>

See
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31214555/setting-up-app-engine-for-dart-gcloud-preview-error)
for a suggested workaround.
</aside>

The "200 2" status indicates a successful launch. The first few times that
you build you may see some `50x` errors. Also, this step can take awhile
the first time that you run it since `pub get` is run inside a container
that fetches several megabytes of data.

<div style="padding:5px;background-color:LightYellow;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:WhiteSmoke;" markdown="1">
  **Tip:** If you try to preview your app and you get an
  "Unable to bind localhost:8080" error, another process
  might be using port 8080. Use one of the following commands to see what
  process is listening on this port.

<pre style="border-style:none;background-color:LightYellow">
  $ sudo lsof -i :8080  [Mac OS X or Linux]
  $ netstat -ano        [Windows]
</pre>

  You can either kill the process, or you can specify a different
  port to the <code>gcloud preview app</code> command using the
  <code>--host</code> flag. For example:

<pre style="border-style:none;background-color:LightYellow">
  --host localhost:7777
  --host 127.0.0.1:7777
</pre>
</div>
 
## View the app in the browser

In your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
You should see "Hello, World!"

<img src="images/helloworldoutput.png" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;" alt="Output from HelloWorld app">

If you make any changes to the code, for example, if you change
"Hello, World!" to "Hola, Mundo!" and save the file, the development server
restarts the Dart server application.
Refresh the browser to see the change.

## Modifying your code

When the application is running locally, changes to files in the
application directory are monitored. Changes to an application file
cause the application to restart and run the new code.

## How it works

This diagram shows how the app runs in the App Engine development server.

<img src="images/managedVMwithdocker.png" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;" alt="How the different components relate">

For this simple example, you don't need to worry about `pub serve`.
You'll learn more about the role that `pub serve` plays in
[Get the client/server code and run it
locally](client-server/#get-the-code).

## Deploying to App Engine

Deploying helloworld to App Engine is as simple as running the following
command:

<pre>
$ gcloud preview app deploy app.yaml
</pre>

Note that this command can take awhile.

Then navigate to `http://helloworld.my_project_name.appspot.com/`
and you should see "Hello, world!"
